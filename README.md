#### MVP 

- [ ] Utilize React Router, installed via npm
- [ ] Have at least 6 separate, rendered components
- [ ] Use Axios to consume data from Airtable, and GET/render that data in your components
- [ ] Use "Mobile First" principles to dynamically style web app
- [ ] Use Axios to POST/create new data on Airtable
- [ ] Use only React for DOM Manipulation
- [ ] Display gigs after search (based on location, date, and artist)
- [ ] Post gigs using a form

#### PostMVP  

- [ ] Utilize the Google Maps API to display gigs geographically
- [ ] Add ability to anonymously "like" gigs (ex. "I'll be there!" +1)
- [ ] Display gigs based on "likes"

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

Organization and functionality (making the code look good)

### Weaknesses:

CSS/Styling

### Opportunities:

I am looking forward to challenging myself with the "likes" functionality as well as the styling.

### Threats:

Getting too disorganized and inefficient within the CSS
